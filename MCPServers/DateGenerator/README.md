# Date Generator MCP Server

This MCP server provides tools for generating dates based on month, year, and day of week criteria. It's converted from the original HTML/CSS/JavaScript date generator web application.

## Features

- Generate all dates in a specific month/year that fall on a chosen day of the week
- Get available options for months, years, and days of week
- Includes metadata like days from today, weeks from today, and past/future indicators
- Input validation and error handling

## Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bruceguthrie/Desktop/claude_workspace/new/date-generator-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Server

```bash
npm start
```

Or for development with auto-restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Available Tools

#### 1. `generate_dates`
Generates all dates in a given month/year that fall on a specific day of the week.

**Parameters:**
- `month` (number): Month number (1-12)
- `year` (number): Year (e.g., 2024)
- `dayOfWeek` (number): Day of week (0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 6=Saturday)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "month": 12,
  "year": 2024,
  "dayOfWeek": 1
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "query": {
    "month": "December",
    "year": 2024,
    "dayOfWeek": "Monday"
  },
  "totalDates": 5,
  "dates": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "date": "2024-12-02",
      "formatted": "Monday, December 2, 2024",
      "daysFromToday": 139,
      "weeksFromToday": 19.86,
      "isPast": false,
      "isToday": false,
      "isFuture": true
    }
    // ... more dates
  ]
}
```

#### 2. `get_options`
Gets available months, years, and days of week for selection.

**Parameters:** None

**Response:**
```json
{
  "months": [
    { "value": 1, "name": "January" },
    { "value": 2, "name": "February" },
    // ... all months
  ],
  "years": [2020, 2021, 2022, ..., 2050],
  "daysOfWeek": [
    { "value": 0, "name": "Sunday" },
    { "value": 1, "name": "Monday" },
    // ... all days
  ],
  "currentYear": 2025
}
```

## Key Differences from Original Web App

1. **Server-side**: Runs as a Node.js server instead of in the browser
2. **JSON API**: Returns structured JSON data instead of HTML output
3. **MCP Protocol**: Uses Model Context Protocol for tool-based interactions
4. **Enhanced Metadata**: Includes more detailed information about each date
5. **No UI**: Pure data processing without HTML/CSS interface

## Original Logic Preserved

The core date calculation logic from your original `generateDates()` function has been preserved and enhanced:

- Same month/year/day-of-week filtering
- Same date formatting options
- Same "days from today" and "weeks from today" calculations
- Enhanced with additional metadata and better error handling

## Error Handling

The server includes comprehensive input validation:
- Month must be 1-12
- Year must be 1900-2100
- Day of week must be 0-6
- Graceful handling of invalid inputs

## Development Notes

- Uses ES6 modules (`type: "module"` in package.json)
- Includes `--watch` flag for development auto-restart
- Follows MCP server patterns and conventions
- Can be extended with additional date-related tools
