## ðŸš¨ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository, **please do not open a public issue or pull request**. That helps prevent malicious actors from seeing and exploiting the problem before itâ€™s resolved.

Instead, please report it privately via one of the following options:

- **GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting** (preferred):  
  [Go to the repository's Security tab](../../security/advisories) and click **"Report a vulnerability."**

- **Email (optional backup):**  
  You may also contact me directly at: `gu3dump@outlook.com`  


## ðŸ”’ What Happens Next

- I will review and acknowledge your report as soon as possible.
- If the issue is valid and confirmed, Iâ€™ll take steps to address it promptly.
- Depending on the nature of the issue, I may publish a GitHub Security Advisory to document the fix.

## ðŸ’¬ Scope

This repository contains **example code and working samples**, intended for personal and educational use. Even so, I take potential security risks seriously and appreciate all responsible reports.

Thank you for doing your part to make open source better and safer!
